1.0 release
  latest negentropy
  make all std::function's const refs
  split source meta-data off Event table 
  remove prefix matching
    fix related github bug, add tests




triage
  get rid of "too many tags in filter" error
  split plugins for relay/stream
  test negentropy queries stored in events
  more config params in negentropy
  ? limit for total number of events, not just per filter


features
  in sync/stream, log bytes up/down and compression ratios
  "router" app, where multiple stream/sync connections handled in one process/config (the "nginx of nostr")
  NIP-42 AUTH
  slow-websocket connection detection and back-pressure
  pre-calcuated tree negentropy XOR trees to support full-db scans (optionally limited by since/until)
    ? maybe just use daily/fixed-size bucketing
  improve delete command
    * delete by receivedAt, IP addrs, etc
    * inverted filter: delete events that *don't* match the provided filter
  ? less verbose default logging
  ? kill plugin if it times out

rate limits (maybe not needed now that we have plugins?)
  event writes per second per ip
  max connections per ip (nginx?)
  max bandwidth up/down (nginx?)
  log IP address in sendNoticeError and elsewhere where it makes sense
  ? events that contain IP/pubkey/etc block-lists in their contents
  ? limit on total number of events from a DBScan, not just per filter
  ? time limit on DBScan

misc
  ? periodic reaping of disconnected sockets (maybe autoping is doing this already)
  ? warn when run as root
  docs: mention you have to run `make update-submodules` after a pull
