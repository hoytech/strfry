triage
  split plugins for relay/stream
  more config params in negentropy
  ? limit for total number of events, not just per filter


features
  in sync/stream, log bytes up/down and compression ratios
  NIP-42 AUTH
  slow-websocket connection detection and back-pressure
  ? less verbose default logging
  ? kill plugin if it times out

rate limits (maybe not needed now that we have plugins?)
  event writes per second per ip
  max connections per ip (nginx?)
  max bandwidth up/down (nginx?)
  log IP address in sendNoticeError and elsewhere where it makes sense
  ? events that contain IP/pubkey/etc block-lists in their contents
  ? limit on total number of events from a DBScan, not just per filter
  ? time limit on DBScan

misc
  ? periodic reaping of disconnected sockets (maybe autoping is doing this already)
  ? warn when run as root
