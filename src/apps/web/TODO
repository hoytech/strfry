  ! caching of follower count
  ! maybe limit user export size?
  * non-500 error pages when bech32 fails to parse, for example
  * search field: enter anything, pubkey (hex or npub), eventId, etc. maybe even full-text search?
  * rss

styling
  ! make login/upvote/etc buttons do something when not logged in/no nostr plugin installed
  - slightly grey out visited links
  ? limit name length: http://localhost:8080/u/npub1e44hczvjqvnp5shx9tmapmw5w6q9x98wdrd2lxhmwfsdmuf5gp9qwvpk6g
  ? smarter truncation/abbrev (try to cut at a sentence, or word boundary, don't cut URLs or UTF-8)
  ? abbrev comments should be smaller? non-pre tag?

misc
  ! docs
  ? nip-05 checkmarks

write
  ? edit profile (or maybe just send them to https://metadata.nostr.com/)
  - if nostr:npub1... appears in note content when users is posting, add it as p-tag "mention"
