  ? pagination on communities?
  - nostr: links not replaced in community titles
  * caching
  * non-500 error pages when bech32 fails to parse, for example
  * search field: enter anything, pubkey (hex or npub), eventId, etc. maybe even full-text search?
  * rss
  * click on up/down vote counts to see who voted

styling
  ! test a bit on mobile
  ! make login/upvote/etc buttons do something when not logged in/no nostr plugin installed
  - slightly grey out visited links
  - reduce green colour, test dark mode
  ? limit name length: http://localhost:8080/u/npub1e44hczvjqvnp5shx9tmapmw5w6q9x98wdrd2lxhmwfsdmuf5gp9qwvpk6g
  ? smarter truncation/abbrev (try to cut at a sentence, or word boundary, don't cut URLs)
  ? abbrev comments should be smaller? non-pre tag?

misc
  ! nginx/systemd/deb deploy stuff
  ! docs
  * nip-05 checkmarks

write
  ? edit profile (or maybe just send them to https://metadata.nostr.com/)
  - if nostr:npub1... appears in note content when users is posting, add it as p-tag "mention"
