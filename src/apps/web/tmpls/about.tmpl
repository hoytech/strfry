        Hi, thanks for stopping by! Oddbean is a discussion site built on <a href="https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr">the nostr protocol</a>. The design is inspired by Hacker News and Reddit because I want it to be a familiar experience, with fast loading pages and minimal distractions.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Why nostr?</b> Nostr is the closest thing we have to an honest-to-goodness decentralised social media protocol. Oddbean is just one of many interfaces to the same network. Even though many of the posts don't originate here, Oddbean users can still interact with anyone else on the network. If you get tired of Oddbean, you can move to another client.

        <b>No crap.</b> No elements bouncing around as the page loads. No cookie pop-ups. In fact, no cookies, period. No tracking analytics. No "sign-up to our newsletter" modals that appear half way down. No invitation gating. No dark patterns to boost engagement numbers. Javascript is optional (only needed for posting).
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>No images.</b> The written word is one of the greatest achievements of civilisation. They say "a picture is worth a thousand words", but consider this: If you give me a picture, I can describe it in exquisite detail using a thousand words. But if I give you a thousand words, can you draw a picture that conveys all this information?

        <b>How do I login?</b> You don't. If you want to post or vote, use a browser extension such as nos2x (<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nos2x/kpgefcfmnafjgpblomihpgmejjdanjjp">chrome</a>, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/nos2x-fox/">firefox</a>), or one of <a href="https://github.com/aljazceru/awesome-nostr#nip-07-browser-extensions">several others.</a> After installing, click "login" in the top-right and allow Oddbean to read your public key. To setup your profile, use a site like <a href="https://metadata.nostr.com/">Nostr Profile Manager</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Feeds.</b> Oddbean is built around the concept of "feeds", which are lists of nostr events. Feeds can be curated by people, algorithms, or a combination of the two. If you want to curate your own feed, check out the <a href="https://github.com/hoytech/strfry/blob/oddbean/docs/feeds.md">specification</a>. If you are interested, here is the <a href="https://github.com/hoytech/strfry/tree/oddbean/src/apps/web">full source code for Oddbean</a>. The <a href="/f/homepage/info">homepage</a> is a feed like any other, except one that I control. Don't like it? Don't use it.
