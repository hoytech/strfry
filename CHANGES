0.9.5
  * New feature: strfry router!
  * INCOMPATIBLE change: The "lookbehind" feature of plugins was removed
  * INCOMPATIBLE change to negentropy sync protocol! (again)
    - The fingerprint function has now been changed to SHA-256, to protect the
      integrity of the sync mechanism in the presence of adversarial event creators
    - Going forward, the protocol now has mechanisms for backwards/forwards compatibility
  * Bugfix: Prevent a crash when a non-indexOnly scan was paused and then one of the
    buffered levIds was deleted or replaced before the scan resumed
  * Plugins can now be specified as shell commands, so you can pass command-line switches
    to them, set environment variables, use pipes/redirects, etc.
  * Plugins now propagate the environment variables of the strfry process to the
    plugin processes
  * Now if you don't return a "msg" (or return an empty string), it will no longer
    pollute your logs with "blocked event" messages

0.9.4
  * INCOMPATIBLE change to negentropy sync protocol!
    - Necessary because the protocol had an unfixable issue when syncing a very large DB
      into a small DB while using frameSizeLimit (sorry!)
  * If a client disconnects before its pending EVENT write messages have been processed,
    drop those messages instead of trying to write them
  * Bulk export commands now exit gracefully on a SIGPIPE
  * Fixed a race condition when sync command exits
  * Some optimisations in sync and export
  * noReadAhead config option: can reduce IO usage on instances where DB size > memory
  * Close the LMDB map file when execing plugins (works around LMDB bug)

0.9.3
  * Limit on events that can be processed by a sync
    - Configurable with relay.negentropy.maxSyncEvents
  * Warn when NIP-11 pubkey is in incorrect format (#52)
  * Bugfix: Setting rejectEphemeralEventsOlderThanSeconds larger than ephemeralEventsLifetimeSeconds did
    not work because events were then considered expired
  * Config parameter to silence "Rejected invalid event" logs: relay.logging.invalidEvents
  * Detect overflows when rejectEvents* config params are set very large
